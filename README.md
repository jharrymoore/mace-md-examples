### `mace_md` Examples



This repository contains some minimal run scripts for mace-md, the front-end for running MACE MD simulations with openMM


This repository will evolve as functionality is added, please open an issue if something is unclear or there is missing functionality



Included files:
- `test_files` includes a set of pre-computed trajectories, including a vacuum simulation of a small molecule and a replica exchange simulation for a ML->MM free energy calculation



Notebooks
- `visualisation.ipynb` contains basic trajectory visualisation and examples of computing a few useful properties using MDAnalysis
- `repex_analysis.ipynb` contains scripts to analyse replica exchange simualtions and check convergence of free energies
